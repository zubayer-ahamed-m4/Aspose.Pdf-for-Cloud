## Aspose.Pdf for Cloud 
[Aspose.Pdf for Cloud](https://www.aspose.com/products/pdf/cloud) helps you manipulate elements of a PDF file like text, annotations, watermark, signature, bookmarks, stamps and so on. Its REST API also allows you to add images to a PDF file or convert PDF to images as well as managing PDF pages by using features like PDF merging, splitting and inserting.

This repository contains [Data](Data), [Examples](Examples) and [SDKs](SDKs) for [Aspose.Pdf for Cloud](https://www.aspose.com/products/pdf/cloud) to help you learn and write your own applications.

[Data](Data) folder at the root contains input files which both Examples and SDKs (Unit test case project) used. It is mandatory that you download the Data folder.

## Why SDKs?
Aspose.Pdf for Cloud is implemented as a REST API. If you use SDK, it hides the REST API calls and lets you use Aspose.Pdf features in a native way for your preferred language.
